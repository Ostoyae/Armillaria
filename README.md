Armillaria, Is the project git repo. currently none of the other module are still in develpoment. pull this repo and it's submodules would result in nothing.

I'm unsure if this repo will have any main fuctionality or just a home for all repos relating to this project.

Armillaria project is a learning project in using Rust and Grpc to create a scaleable microservice.
